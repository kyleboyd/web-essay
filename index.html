    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p  class="larger">This essay sets out to explain how Tim Berneers-Lee the creator of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has changed how we live today.</p>
    
    <a name="health"></a>
        <h2>Health</h2>
    <p> In today’s society we are all connected. There has never been an easier time in human history for people to be able to search and find such a wide range of documents that the world wide web has to offer. This was made possible by a man called Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist that invented the world wide web in 1989, little did he know that this invention would change the way humans live and how our society functions as a whole. This is why I have asked the question “how has Tim Berners-Lee changed the way we live today”. Some of the positive and negative topics that we will be outlining are as fallows; physical/mental health, social skills, security, communication, access to information, business applications and convenience. The main focus of this essay will be how these properties effect the way we live in our everyday lives. </p>
                
    <p> One of the worldwide web’s greatest attributes is how much information it holds which we can all access. If someone asks a question that no one knows, the iconic reply is “google it”. Search engines have made the web so easy to use and this has opened up an endless stream of knowledge and possibility. The web is always being monitored and on Monday, 25th November 2019 the indexed web contained at least 6.19 billion pages, this is always growing and there is no knowing the limit this could reach. All of these pages are at our disposal, this is a huge amount of information that we can access if and when we need to. This has made a huge impact on our everyday lives, nearly anything we want to know can be found on the internet, this makes it extremely easy to self-educate and become more enlightened on a wide range of subjects. This is one of the aspects of the internet that is so beneficial</p>

    <p>The world wide web is arguably one of the most ground-breaking inventions of the 20th century and this is very evident due to how it took off. There are more than 7,500.000.000 people currently occupying the world, but over half of these individuals have access and use the internet with over 4 billion using it every day. Due to the vast number of users that interact with the web there is now a global network that links us all together and this is one of the main reasons that have made the web so innovative. One of the main reasons that the web has grew so popular is down to the advancement’s in technology and the growth of devices being used in our everyday lives such as the smartphone, we have grown so attached to these devices that we treat these as an extension of our selves, for some individuals their smartphone is nearly as important as a crutch, as an injured individual needs this to walk we are starting. To need our devises to live our lives. Another reason the web is popular is that it Is a non-discriminative platform which anyone can access via a service provider. These services are relatively cheap to have a subscription to. An few examples of these providers are as fallows Sky, Virgin and BT. Although the web is an incredible invention it has many pros and cons. We are going to look at these now. </p>

    <a name="physical"></a> 
    <h2>Physical</h2>
    <p> It is extremely clear today that we are the most internet savvy generation when it comes to our mental/physical health, this is due to our education system and the continued rise of the importance of talking about mental health. Nevertheless, while the web can be useful to connect with others to talk about mental health it can also be its downfall. Mental health is arguably much more important, and this is also affected by the over use of the web. It can cause an increase in an individual’s anxiety, you have a higher risk of depression and it causes a negative impact on your social skills. We are considered to be social media generation, and this can have a negative aspect on our health. We as a generation see the world through a filter that social media has created, this only lets us see what people choose to post or share and that nine times out of ten the best parts of their lives. This false pretence presents an illustration of a luxurious life with no issues or problem which puts pressure on individuals to have the same lifestyle and this isn’t always possible, this is what causes a rise in anxiety. </p>

    <a name="security"></a>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p> While we are all online, we always have to be vigilant towards the risks that there are on the web. When we are online, we are all in danger from a number of security risks that put our own personal details in harm’s way. Not only individuals are at risk, business and anything on the web will always be at risk simply due to the fact that there will always be individuals that have malicious intent. Some of the risks that we are exposed to are as fallows; viruses, trojan horses, fraud and adware/spyware. The most common risk to individuals are viruses, approximately 33% of household computers are affected with a type of malware in which more than half of these are viruses. These viruses and malware steal data from the device that is infected such as passwords or even go as far as to delete data from your hard drive. </p>

    <a name="business"></a>
    <h2>Business</h2>
    <p> Business is another area of life that has been hugely affected by the internet. Three examples of companies that have benefited from the use of the creation of the web are amazon, Facebook and google. Fortune 500 rank these three companies within the top 60. Amazon was ranked 5th, Alphabet who owns Google were ranked 15th and Facebook was ranked 57th. The reason that I have specifically chosen these companies are because without the internet they would simplify ether not exist or more likely not be anywhere near as successful as they currently are. As of the 9th of December 2019, amazons market cap was worth $865.57billion, Alphabet’s cap was worth $926.45billion and Facebook’s cap worth was $572.94 billion. These three companies owe everything to the web because without it, they would never have reached the success they have. Amazon, google and Facebook have utilised the web each in different ways but each as widely successful.</p>

    <p>The web has created so many business applications that are used by the majority of companies today. One aspect that they can utilise is to advertise on their websites, this is much more cost efficient and reaches a larger audience then using a billboard for example. If the company has a product that they wish to sell they can also manage this using e-commerce on their websites. E-commerce allows a website to sell all their products through the web. Not only has this changed the way businesses function but also the way we shop. We can nearly buy anything online in today’s society, in recent years we have also even started to buy our groceries online. Buy shopping online this saves us leaving our abode, this can be a positive and negative, it is extremely convenient but can also be bad for our health. </p>

    <a name="social"></a>
    <h2>Social Media</h2>
    <p> Social media is another huge area that has made an impact on our everyday lives. Social media, like everything has a number of positives and negatives. It allows users to communicate and share with other co users on a worldwide scale. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and twitter are the four of the big hitters when it comes to social media platforms. Subsequently through these platforms instant messaging has also been adapted and improved which has helped make them take off.</p>

    <a name="entertainment"></a>
    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
    <p> During my lifetime I have seen a massive shift in the entertainment industry. When I was a young boy tv was probably at its peak, that’s how everyone watched their favourite shows, movie and documentaries but as time has went on this has taken a massive turn and shifted towards streaming. Companies such as YouTube, Netflix and prime video have completely taken the world by storm by being the first companies to stream tv series, movies and documentaries online. This meant that you can access your favourite shows from anywhere as long as u have a device and an internet connection. By These companies establishing this innovation it has nearly taken away the need for cable tv. Although this is going to be detrimental to cable tv this is clearly the future of entertainment. As time goes on Cable tv will be a thing of the past and their will only be digital streaming </p>

    <a name="education"></a>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p> Our education system is another area that has been immensely impacted by the world wide web. Schools and other academic institutes used to be limited to teach what was in the textbooks that they owed but this has all been expanded with the web. An individual can now take online courses that educate them on the selected area of choice. The web has opened up a wide range of options for our education, learning something is simply a click way. </p>
        
    <a name="conclusion"></a>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p> I feel that it is very evident that by inventing the web Tim Berners lee has made a monumental impact on the way we live in today’s society. He has made an impact on nearly every aspect of our lives whether it be our health, job, education or social life. Next to this the web is still in the early stages of its life which leaves the question, just how much will it the web impact the way we live in our everyday lives. </p>
